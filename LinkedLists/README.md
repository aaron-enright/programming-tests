# Linked Lists
20 years ago, undergrads in Computer Science might consider linked-lists one of the more difficult second-year assignments.   Unfortunately, with all the "canned" data structures these days, it seems like
some undergrads finish four years of college without ever implementing one.   The questions here, given in three languages (C++, Java, and C#) help to clarify if a programmer is *capable* of implementing
a data structure.

Like all my programming tests, the idea is not necessarily to get the "right" answer (If you believe that there is ever only one right answer, please quit programming and become the religious zelot you
were born to be), but to discuss with the candidate how they approach the problem and evaluate their reasoning process.  I would expect minimally competant programmers to be able to answer the first two
questions, and any decent programmer to answer all of them in under an hour.
